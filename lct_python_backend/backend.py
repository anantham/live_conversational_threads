Each conversational shift should be captured as a new node with defined relationships, with primary emphasis on capturing rich contextual connections that demonstrate thematic coherence, conceptual evolution, and cross-conversational idea building.
**Formatting Rules:**

**Instructions:**

**Handling New JSON Creation**
Extract Key Nodes: Identify all topic shifts in the conversation. Each topic shift forms a new "node", even if the topic was discussed earlier.

**Strictly Generate JSON Output:**
[
  {
    "node_name": "Title of the conversational thread",
    "type": "conversational_thread" or "bookmark",
    "predecessor": "Previous node name temporally",
    "successor": "Next node name temporally",
    "contextual_relation": {
      "Related Node 1": "Detailed explanation of how this node connects thematically, shows conceptual evolution, and builds upon ideas from the current discussion",
      "Related Node 2": " Another comprehensive explanation that weaves together thematic connections with how concepts have developed",
      "...": "Additional related nodes with their respective explanations can be included as needed"
    },
    "linked_nodes": [
      "List of all nodes this node is either drawing context from or providing context to"
    ],
    "chunk_id": null,  // This field will be **ignored** for now and will be added externally.
    "is_bookmark": true or false,
    ""is_contextual_progress": true or false,
    "summary": "Detailed description of what was discussed in this node."
  }
]
**Enhanced Contextual Relations Approach:**
-	In "contextual_relation", provide integrated explanations that naturally weave together:
-	How nodes connect thematically (shared concepts, related ideas)
-	How concepts have evolved or been refined since previous mentions
-	How ideas build upon each other across different conversation segments
-	 Don't capture direct shifts in conversations as contextual_relation unless there is a relevant contextual relation only then capture it.
Create cohesive narratives that explain the full relationship context rather than treating these as separate analytical dimensions.

**Define Structure:**
"predecessor" → The direct previous node temporally (empty for first node only).
"successor" → The direct next node temporally.
"contextual_relation" → Use this to explain how past nodes contribute to the current discussion contextually.
•	Keys = node names that contribute context.
•	Values = a detailed explanation of how the multiple referenced nodes influence the current discussion.

"linked_nodes" → A comprehensive list of all nodes this node is either drawing context from or providing context to, this information of context providing will come from "contextual_relation", consolidating references into a single field.
"chunk_id" → This field will be ignored for now, as it will be added externally by the code.

**Handling Updates to Existing JSON**
If an existing JSON structure is provided along with the transcript, modify it as follows and strictly return only the nodes generated for the current input transcript:

- **Continuing a topic**: If the conversation continues an existing discussion, update the "successor" field of the last relevant node.
-	**New topic**: If a conversation introduces a new topic, create a new node and properly link it.
-	**Revisiting a Bookmark**: If "LLM wish bookmark open [name]" appears, find the existing bookmark node and update its "contextual_relation" and "linked_nodes". Do NOT create a new bookmark when revisited—update the existing one instead.
-	**Contextual Relation Updates**: Maintain connections that demonstrate how past discussions influence current ones through integrated thematic, evolutionary, and developmental relationships.

**Chronology, Contextual Referencing and Bookmarking**
If a topic is revisited, create a new node while ensuring proper linking to previous mentions through rich contextual relations. Ensure mutual linking between nodes that provide context to each other through comprehensive relationship explanations.

**Each node must include both "predecessor" and "successor" fields to maintain chronological flow, maintaining the flow of the conversation irrespective of how related the topics are and strictly based on temporal relationship. Don't have predecessor empty if it is not the first node ever.**


**Conversational Threads nodes (type: "conversational_thread"):**
- Every topic shift must be captured as a new node.
- "contextual_relation" must provide integrated explanations of how previous discussions contribute to the current conversation through thematic connections, conceptual evolution, and idea building.
- "linked_nodes" must track all nodes this node is either drawing context from or providing context to in a single list.
- For nodes with type="conversational_thread", always set "is_bookmark": false.
 **Handling Revisited Topics**
 If a conversation returns to a previously discussed topic, create a new node and ensure "contextual_relation" provides comprehensive explanations of how past discussions relate to current context.

**Bookmark nodes (type: "bookmark") must:**
- A bookmark node must be created when "LLM wish bookmark create" appears, capturing the contextually relevant topic.
- Do not create bookmark node unless "LLM wish bookmark create" is mentioned.
- "contextual_relation" must reference nodes with integrated explanations of relationships, ensuring contextual continuity.
- The summary should clearly describe the reason for creating the bookmark and what it aims to track.
- If "LLM wish bookmark open" appears, do not create a new bookmark—update the existing one.
- For nodes with type="bookmark", always set "is_bookmark": true.



**Contextual Progress Capture ("is_contextual_progress": true):**
-	Only If "LLM wish capture contextual progress" appears, update the existing node (either "conversational_thread" or "bookmark") to include:
o	"is_contextual_progress": true
-	Contextual progress capture is used to capture a potential insight that might be present in that conversational node. 
-	It represents part of the conversation that could potentially be an insight that could be useful. These "potential insights" are the directions provided by humans that can later be taken by AI, which then uses this to generate formalisms.
-	Do not create a new node for contextual progress capture. Instead, apply the flag to the relevant existing node where the potential insight was introduced or referenced.
-**Contextual Relation & Linked Nodes Updates:**
- "contextual_relation" must provide comprehensive, integrated explanations that demonstrate the full scope of how nodes relate through thematic coherence, conceptual development, and cross-conversational idea building as unified relationship narratives.
- Don't capture direct shifts in conversations as contextual_relation unless there is a relevant contextual relation only then capture it.
- "linked_nodes" must include all references in a single list, capturing all nodes this node draws from or informs.
- The structure of "predecessor", "successor", and "contextual_relation" must ensure logical and chronological consistency between past and present discussions.

**Transcript:**
Sam: Hey Taylor, I've got the mock-ups and timeline draft for the budgeting app.
Taylor: Nice! That covers the MVP milestones?
Sam: Yeah—dashboard, sync API, and notification system.
Taylor: Perfect. But we still haven't locked down pricing strategy.
Sam: Right. Ads, subscriptions, or freemium—still up in the air.
Taylor: We can survey beta users next week.
Sam: LLM wish bookmark create Startup Planning.
Taylor: Speaking of habits—have you stuck to your morning workout routine?
Sam: Mostly. I'm trying to anchor it to my coffee—habit stacking like we discussed.
Taylor: That's the best way. Pairing it with your podcast time might help too.
Sam: Good idea. I could listen to product strategy episodes while lifting.
Taylor: LLM wish capture contextual progress Fitness Habit Loop.
Sam: Quick tangent—remember when we talked about launching that writing tool?
Taylor: You mean the AI-assisted outlining app? Yeah. That convo got buried under budgeting app chaos.
Sam: Exactly. I still think it's viable. We had notes on use cases from early users.
Taylor: Let's revive it. Might even share infrastructure with the budgeting app backend.
Sam: LLM wish bookmark create Outlining Tool Revival.
Taylor: Okay, circling back—what's our go-to API for the budgeting app?
Sam: Plaid is expensive but reliable. Yodlee's cheaper, but older.
Taylor: And SaltEdge?
Sam: Less US coverage. I'm leaning Plaid.
Taylor: Cool, let's roll with it for beta. Add it to Startup Planning.
Sam: Done.
Taylor: So how do we test the pricing options?
Sam: I could build an A/B test into onboarding flows.
Taylor: Perfect. One with a free tier, one with premium-only.
Sam: And track conversion vs. churn. I'll prototype it.
Sam: LLM wish capture contextual progress Monetization Strategy.
Taylor: Oh, forgot to tell you—I pulled our old Notion doc on the outlining tool.
Sam: The one from last summer?
Taylor: Yep. User feedback section is gold. Matches what you said last week.
Sam: Let's cross-link that to our new app discussions too—some onboarding overlap.
Taylor: LLM wish bookmark open Outlining Tool Revival.
Sam: By the way, I watched that cyber-noir series finale. Intense!
Taylor: Don't spoil! I'm one episode behind.
Sam: Fine, but the twist connects to what we said about nonlinear story arcs in tools.
Taylor: Good point. Our outlining app should support multi-threaded plotting.
Sam: Anyway, quick check—what are today's key Startup Planning items?
Taylor: 1. Confirm Plaid. 2. Draft onboarding split test. 3. Prep beta survey questions.
Sam: Got it. I'll document and sync.
Taylor: Hey, back to the outlining app—we should prototype a plot tree view.
Sam: Like a drag-and-drop node system?
Taylor: Yes. With contextual linking between subplots. Nonlinear story design baked in.
Sam: Just like we talked about for knowledge graphs in the budgeting app.
Taylor: Exactly.
Sam: LLM wish bookmark open Startup Planning.
Taylor: I'll update with today's changes and next steps: implement API, finalize A/B logic, send beta invites.
Sam: I love how both projects are feeding into each other—makes the architecture stronger.
Taylor: Yeah, and it's helping us think modular.

Each conversational shift should be captured as a new node with defined relationships, with primary emphasis on capturing rich contextual connections that demonstrate thematic coherence, conceptual evolution, and cross-conversational idea building.
**Formatting Rules:**

**Instructions:**

**Handling New JSON Creation**
Extract Key Nodes: Identify all topic shifts in the conversation. Each topic shift forms a new "node", even if the topic was discussed earlier.

**Strictly Generate JSON Output:**
[
  {
    "node_name": "Title of the conversational thread",
    "predecessor": "Previous node name",
    "successor": "Next node name",
    "contextual_relation": {
      "Related Node 1": "Detailed explanation of how this node connects thematically, shows conceptual evolution, and builds upon ideas from the current discussion",
      "Related Node 2": " Another comprehensive explanation that weaves together thematic connections with how concepts have developed",
      "...": "Additional related nodes with their respective explanations can be included as needed"
    },
    "chunk_id": null,  // This field will be **ignored** for now and will be added externally.
    "linked_nodes": [
      "List of all nodes this node is either drawing context from or providing context to"
    ],
    "is_bookmark": true or false,
    ""is_contextual_progress": true or false,
    "summary": "Detailed description of what was discussed in this node.",
    "claims": [                    // NEW-  may be empty
  "Fact-checkable claim made by a speaker in this node",
  "Another claim, if present"]
  }
]
**Enhanced Contextual Relations Approach:**
-	In "contextual_relation", provide integrated explanations that naturally weave together:
-	How nodes connect thematically (shared concepts, related ideas)
-	How concepts have evolved or been refined since previous mentions
-	How ideas build upon each other across different conversation segments
-	 Don’t capture direct shifts in conversations as contextual_relation unless there is a relevant contextual relation only then capture it.
- "linked_nodes" must track all nodes this node is either drawing context from or providing context to in a single list.
Create cohesive narratives that explain the full relationship context rather than treating these as separate analytical dimensions.

**Define Structure:**
"predecessor" → The direct previous node temporally.
"successor" → The direct next node temporally.
"contextual_relation" → Use this to explain how past nodes contribute to the current discussion contextually.
•	Keys = node names that contribute context.
•	Values = a detailed explanation of how the multiple referenced nodes influence the current discussion.
"chunk_id" → This field will be ignored for now, as it will be added externally by the code.

**Claims Field Detection and Handling**
"claims" must include only explicit, fact-checkable assertions made by a speaker.
A claim is considered fact-checkable if it states something that can be independently verified or falsified using objective data or authoritative sources.
If no valid claims exist in the node, leave "claims": [].
Do not include:
Opinions or subjective statements (“Plaid seems better”)
Suggestions, questions, or hypotheticals (“Should we go with Plaid?”)
Abstract or untestable beliefs (“I feel Plaid is more modern”)

Be strictly conservative:
If a statement feels uncertain, implied, subjective, speculative, or ambiguous, do not include it as a claim.
Only add when there is a clear, confident declaration that something is true or factual, regardless of actual correctness.
Claims may be true or false—this field captures assertions, not verified facts.
Additionally, claims must include enough context to be independently verified:
A valid claim must provide sufficient specificity (e.g., named entities, timeframes, data, measurable outcomes) to be fact-checked without relying on implicit assumptions.
Avoid fragmentary or vague claims that cannot be verified on their own.
Claims should be self-contained, meaning a reviewer unfamiliar with the full transcript should still understand what is being asserted.

Multiple factual claims may be listed when clearly present.

**Handling Updates to Existing JSON**
If an existing JSON structure is provided along with the transcript, modify it as follows and strictly return only the nodes generated for the current input transcript:

- **Continuing a topic**: If the conversation continues an existing discussion, update the "successor" field of the last relevant node.
-	**New topic**: If a conversation introduces a new topic, create a new node and properly link it.
-	**Revisiting a Bookmark**: If "LLM wish bookmark open [name]" appears, find the existing bookmark node and update its "contextual_relation". Do NOT create a new bookmark when revisited—update the existing one instead.
-	**Contextual Relation Updates**: Maintain connections that demonstrate how past discussions influence current ones through integrated thematic, evolutionary, and developmental relationships.

**Chronology, Contextual Referencing and Bookmarking**
If a topic is revisited, create a new node while ensuring proper linking to previous mentions through rich contextual relations. Ensure mutual linking between nodes that provide context to each other through comprehensive relationship explanations.

Each node must include both "predecessor" and "successor" fields to maintain chronological flow, maintaining the flow of the conversation irrespective of how related the topics are and strictly based on temporal relationship.

**Conversational Threads nodes(“is_bookmark”: false):**
- Every topic shift must be captured as a new node.
- "contextual_relation" must provide integrated explanations of how previous discussions contribute to the current conversation through thematic connections, conceptual evolution, and idea building.
- For non bookmark nodes, always set "is_bookmark": false.
 **Handling Revisited Topics**
 If a conversation returns to a previously discussed topic, create a new node and ensure "contextual_relation" provides comprehensive explanations of how past discussions relate to current context.

**Bookmark nodes (“is_bookmark”: true) must:**
- A bookmark node must be created when "LLM wish bookmark create" appears, capturing the contextually relevant topic.
- Do not create bookmark node unless "LLM wish bookmark create" is mentioned.
- "contextual_relation" must reference nodes with integrated explanations of relationships, ensuring contextual continuity.
- The summary should clearly describe the reason for creating the bookmark and what it aims to track.
- If "LLM wish bookmark open" appears, do not create a new bookmark—update the existing one.
- For bookmark nodes, always set "is_bookmark": true.



**Contextual Progress Capture ("is_contextual_progress": true):**
-	Only If "LLM wish capture contextual progress" appears, update the existing node (either "conversational_thread" or "bookmark") to include:
o	"is_contextual_progress": true
-	Contextual progress capture is used to capture a potential insight that might be present in that conversational node. 
-	It represents part of the conversation that could potentially be an insight that could be useful. These "potential insights" are the directions provided by humans that can later be taken by AI, which then uses this to generate formalisms.
-	Do not create a new node for contextual progress capture. Instead, apply the flag to the relevant existing node where the potential insight was introduced or referenced.
-**Contextual Relation & Linked Nodes Updates:**
- "contextual_relation" must provide comprehensive, integrated explanations that demonstrate the full scope of how nodes relate through thematic coherence, conceptual development, and cross-conversational idea building as unified relationship narratives.
- Don’t capture direct shifts in conversations as contextual_relation unless there is a relevant contextual relation only then capture it.
- "linked_nodes" must include all references in a single list, capturing all nodes this node draws from or informs.
- The structure of "predecessor", "successor", and "contextual_relation" must ensure logical and chronological consistency between past and present discussions.
- The structure of "predecessor", "successor", and "contextual_relation" must ensure logical and chronological consistency between past and present discussions.

**Example Input**
**Existing JSON:**

**Transcript:**
Alex: Did you see OpenAI's latest update on GPT-4o?
Jordan: Yeah—ChatGPT-4o supports a 128k context window and multimodal inputs natively now.
Alex: That’s a big jump. 3.5-turbo had 16k if I remember correctly.
Jordan: Correct. And the latency on 4o is down significantly—around 232ms in some of their benchmarks.
Alex: LLM wish bookmark create ChatGPT-4o Rollout
Jordan: I’ve been thinking we could integrate it into our knowledge assistant prototype.
Alex: Possibly. We’d need to check pricing. I believe 4o is cheaper than GPT-4, especially for input tokens.
Jordan: Last I checked, GPT-4o input tokens are $5 per million, output $15 per million. GPT-4 was more like $30 output.
Alex: That would drastically lower inference cost for our use case.
Jordan: LLM wish capture contextual progress Assistant Architecture Optimization
Alex: Shifting gears—Stripe is updating their pricing again starting July 1.
Jordan: Yeah, new fee is 3.15% + 25¢ per transaction in the U.S.
Alex: That’s up from 2.9% + 30¢, right?
Jordan: Correct. The impact on margin’s non-trivial—we should update our revenue model.
Alex: Definitely. I’ll flag it to finance.
Jordan: Also, AWS made Graviton3 processors generally available in us-east-1 last week.
Alex: Nice. We saved 18% on EC2 when we switched from x86 to Graviton2 last year.
Jordan: I imagine Graviton3 would be even better. It has 25% better performance-per-watt than Graviton2 according to AWS docs.
Alex: Worth benchmarking for sure.
Jordan: LLM wish capture contextual progress Cloud Cost Optimization Path
Alex: And the mobile web still loads in 3.9 seconds. That’s killing our bounce rate.
Jordan: We need to compress more assets—LCP is at 3.1s on average, above the recommended 2.5s.
Alex: Okay, let’s make it a priority for this sprint.
Jordan: Sounds good. I’ll document the ChatGPT, AWS, and Stripe updates in our shared infra log.

If a node references a past discussion, ensure the past node also updates its \"linked_nodes\" to include the new node.\n\n\nConversational Threads nodes (type: \"conversational_thread\"):\nEvery topic shift must be captured as a new node.\nEach node must include both \"predecessor\" and \"successor\" fields to maintain chronological flow.\n\"contextual_relation\" must explain how previous discussions contribute to the current conversation.\n\"linked_nodes\" must track all nodes this node is either drawing context from or providing context to in a single list.\nFor nodes with type=\"conversational_thread\", always set \"is_bookmark\": False.\nHandling Revisited Topics:\nIf a conversation returns to a previously discussed topic, create a new node instead of merging with an existing one.\nEnsure \"contextual_relation\" references past discussions of the same topic, explaining their relevance in the current context.\nBookmark nodes (type: \"bookmark\") must:\nA bookmark node must be created when \"LLM wish bookmark create\" appears, capturing the contextually relevant topic.\nDo not create bookmark node unless the phrase \"LLM wish bookmark create\" is mentioned.\n\"contextual_relation\" must reference the exact nodes where the bookmark was created and opened, ensuring contextual continuity.\nThe summary should clearly describe the reason for creating the bookmark and what it aims to track.\nIf \"LLM wish bookmark open\" appears, do not create a new bookmark—update the existing one.\nModify \"contextual_relation\" to include the new node where the bookmark was accessed, ensuring that past discussions remain linked.\nProvide a clear explanation of how the revisited discussion builds on the previously stored context.\nFor nodes with type=\"bookmark\", always set \"is_bookmark\": True.\n\nContextual Progress Capture (\"is_contextual_progress\": True)\nOnly If  the whole phrase \"LLM wish capture contextual progress\" appears, update the existing node (either \"conversational_thread\" or \"bookmark\") to include:\n\"is_contextual_progress\": True\nContextual progress capture is used to capture a potential insight that might be present in that conversational node. \nIt represents part of the conversation that could potentially be an insight that could be useful. These \"potential insights\" are the directions provided by humans that can later be taken by AI, which then uses this to generate formalisms.\nDo not create a new node for contextual progress capture. Instead, apply the flag to the relevant existing node where the potential insight was introduced or referenced.\n\nContextual Relation & Linked Nodes Updates:\n\"contextual_relation\" must explain why past discussions are relevant, ensuring clarity in topic evolution.\n\"linked_nodes\" must include all references in a single list, capturing all nodes this node draws from or informs.\nThe structure of \"predecessor\", \"successor\", and \"contextual_relation\" must ensure logical and chronological consistency between past and present discussions.\n\nExample Input (Conversation with Bookmark Spells):\nExisting JSON:\n\nTranscript:\nAlex: Hey Jordan, summer's coming up. We should totally go on a road trip!\nJordan: That sounds awesome! But road trips can get expensive. Gas, food, places to stay… It all adds up.\nAlex: True, but we can budget it out. If we book some places early and plan food stops, we might save some cash.\nJordan: Yeah, maybe we can also stay at some cheap motels or even camp for a few nights.\nAlex: Exactly. I'll make a list of potential stops and places to sleep.\nAlex: LLM wish bookmark create Road Trip Planning.\nJordan: Speaking of planning, I've been trying to fix my sleep schedule. Finals completely messed it up.\nAlex: Oh yeah, I feel you. When people get stressed, they sleep less, which makes them even more stressed, and then they sleep even less.\nJordan: Yep, and then when you add caffeine into the mix, it just makes things worse. I was practically running on energy drinks.\nAlex: Not to mention, when you're sleep-deprived, you tend to eat worse, and bad eating can also make it harder to sleep. It's like everything is connected.\nJordan: So basically, when you're stressed, you don't sleep enough. Then because you don't sleep, you get more stressed, and things like caffeine and bad eating habits just make the whole situation even worse.\nAlex: Exactly. But the good news is that breaking just one part of the cycle—like cutting down on caffeine or trying to fix your sleep schedule—can help stop everything from spiraling out of control.\nJordan: Makes sense. I guess I need to start by drinking less caffeine.\nAlex: Yeah, and maybe try doing something relaxing before bed, like listening to music or reading instead of staring at your phone.\nJordan: LLM wish capture contextual progress Stress-Sleep Cycle.\nAlex: Anyway, did you hear about that new horror movie coming out next month?\nJordan: Oh, yeah! It looks terrifying. I love a good horror flick.\nAlex: We should totally watch it when it releases.\nJordan: Definitely. But no watching it late at night—I'll never get any sleep.\nAlex: Haha, fair enough.\nJordan: Oh, by the way, about that road trip—do you think we should rent a car or use mine?\nAlex: Good question. Your car is solid, but renting might save us some trouble if we're going really far.\nJordan: Yeah, plus, rentals come with insurance, which could be helpful.\nAlex: LLM wish bookmark open Road Trip Planning.\nJordan: Right, so we need to decide if we're driving your car or renting, and we should check gas prices along the way.\nAlex: Yep, and maybe look at rental deals. I'll compare some prices later.\nJordan: Sounds good. Let's lock in a plan soon!\n\n\nExample JSON Output:\n[\n  {\n    \"node_name\": \"Road Trip Planning\",\n    \"type\": \"bookmark\",\n    \"predecessor\": None,\n    \"successor\": \"Fixing Sleep Schedules and Stress\",\n    \"contextual_relation\": {},\n    \"linked_nodes\": [\n      \"Fixing Sleep Schedules and Stress\",\n      \"Road Trip Planning - Car Rental Discussion\"\n    ],\n    \"chunk_id\": None,\n    \"is_bookmark\": True,\n    \"is_contextual_progress\": False,\n    \"summary\": \"Alex and Jordan discuss planning a summer road trip, acknowledging budget concerns.

Definition:
A conversational thread is a contiguous portion of a conversation that:
– Focuses on a coherent sub-topic or goal,
– Is interpretable on its own, without requiring future context,
– Demonstrates clear semantic structure: an initiation, development, and closure.
The input may contain zero, one, or multiple complete conversational threads. It will appear as unstructured text, with no speaker labels, so you must infer structure using topic continuity, transitions, and semantic signals.
Output Specification:
Return a JSON object containing:
"Decision":
– "continue_accumulating" if no complete thread can be identified.
– "stop_accumulating" if at least one complete and self-contained conversational thread exists.
"Completed_segment":

Evaluation Notes:
– Be conservative: If in doubt, continue accumulating.
– Use semantic structure and topic closure to determine completeness — not superficial transitions.
– It is valid to return more than one thread in completed_segment, but each must be complete and independently meaningful.
– Do not rearrange the order of the text. Preserve original sequencing when splitting.

    generate_formalism_prompt ="You are an advanced AI model tasked with transforming structured conversational data and raw text into a concise causal loop diagram (CLD) represented as a dictionary with LOOPY-compatible structure. Your goal is to dynamically infer the relationships between topics discussed in the conversation and convert them into a causal loop diagram, with special focus on extracting formalism in the contextual progress of the conversation.\n\nYou will be provided with three inputs:\n1. conversation_data\n2. raw_text\n3. user_research_background - A description of the user's research interests and background\n\nAnalyze the conversation_data and raw_text to identify causal relationships and create a comprehensive causal loop diagram that aligns with the user's research background.\n\nOutput Format:\nYou must strictly return a dictionary in the following format:\n[\n  [\n    [id, x, y, init, label, color] # this is for nodes,\n    ...\n  ],\n  [\n    [from, to,arc,strength, _] # this is for the edges,\n    ...\n  ],\n  [\n    [x, y, text] # this is for the labels,\n    ...\n  ],\n  meta # this is the meta an integer\n]\n\ntypes of the about output format:\nnode = id - int, x - int, y -int, init - float(always 1), color- int.\nedges= from - int, to - int, arc - int, strength - float, _ = 0.\nlabels= x - int, y - int, text- str.\nmeta - int.\nWhere:\n- meta is the total number of nodes + labels + 2 (for edges).\n- Node id is a unique integer starting from 0.\n- Edges: Each edge refers to valid id values for from and to.\n- Assign random integers to color for different nodes but the integers assigned should be less than total number of nodes divided by 1.5.\n\nIMPORTANT: Only create nodes that have at least one causal relationship (edge) with another node. Do not include isolated nodes without any connecting edges.\n\nCRITICAL: Ensure that your diagram contains at least one complete causal loop where nodes are connected in a cycle (A→B→C→A or similar). The edges in these loops must form a complete circuit so that changes in any node propagate through the entire loop and affect the originating node. These must be genuine loops with actual causal connections, not just visually arranged in a circle.\n\nPRIMARY FOCUS: Prioritize identifying and extracting formalism in the contextual progress of the conversation. Examine how concepts, theories, methods, or structured approaches develop and influence each other throughout the conversation. Only include other nodes if they directly relate to this formalism development.\n\nRESEARCH CONTEXT ALIGNMENT: Frame all node labels, relationships, and concepts using terminology and perspectives relevant to the user's research background. The variables and causal connections should reflect the user's domain of expertise and research interests, making the diagram immediately relevant and intuitive to their field of study.\n\nLoop Detection and Construction:\nActively search for and construct complete causal loops in the conversation:\n- Reinforcing loops: Create cycles where changes amplify around the loop (e.g., A increases B, B increases C, C increases A).\n- Balancing loops: Create cycles that tend to stabilize (e.g., A increases B, B increases C, C decreases A).\n- Make sure every loop is complete with no breaks in the causal chain.\n- Test each loop by mentally tracing the effects: if one node increases, trace the effects through each connection to verify the loop completes and affects the original node.\n\nCausal Relation Detection:\nIdentify and infer causal relationships implicitly from the conversational context, summaries, and shifts between topics. Look for the following:\n1. Causal Direction: Recognize when one concept influences another (e.g., \"this leads to,\" \"this causes,\" \"results in,\" \"this influences\").\n2. Contextual Transitions: When the conversation shifts topics, infer the causal influence or dependency between these topics.\n3. Behavioral and Cognitive Feedback: Consider feedback loops and how certain topics may influence others based on previous discussions.\n\nVariable Naming Conventions:\n1. Use nouns or noun phrases for variable names that align with the user's research field terminology.\n2. Ensure variable names have a clear sense of direction (can be larger or smaller).\n3. Choose variables whose normal sense of direction is positive.\n4. Avoid using variable names containing prefixes indicating negation (non, un, etc.).\n5. Frame concepts using domain-specific language from the user's research background.\n\nEdge Strength Determination:\nDetermine edge strength based on the following scale:\n- Positive Influence → +1.0\n- Negative Influence → -1.0\n\nStep-by-step instructions for creating the CLD:\n1. Review the user's research background to understand their domain, terminology, and conceptual framework.\n2. Analyze the conversation_data and raw_text to identify key topics and concepts, focusing on formalism in the contextual progress.\n3. Create a list of variables (nodes) based on the identified topics, following the variable naming conventions and using terminology relevant to the user's research field.\n4. Determine causal relationships between variables using the causal relation detection guidelines.\n5. Explicitly identify or create at least one complete causal loop where a sequence of nodes connects back to the starting node.\n6. Verify each loop is functional by tracing the effect of increasing one node through the entire loop to confirm it eventually affects itself.\n7. Assign edge strengths based on the provided scale.\n8. Position nodes across a coordinate range (0-800 for x, 0-600 for y) to create a well-distributed visualization with adequate spacing.\n9. Arrange nodes that form loops in positions that clearly show the cyclical nature of their relationships.\n10. Create edges between related nodes, specifying the from and to node ids, and the strength of the relationship. Use appropriate arc values to make loop connections clear.\n11. Add one label to describe the causal loop diagram, positioning it at least 50 coordinate units away from any node to avoid overlap.\n12. Calculate the meta value by summing the total number of nodes, labels, and adding 2 for edges.\n\nFinal Output Formatting:\nConstruct the List with the following lists: \"nodes\", \"edges\", \"labels\", and \"meta\". Ensure that all required fields are included for each node, edge, and label. Double-check that the meta value is correctly calculated and that all node ids and edge references are valid.\n\nPresent your final output as a single list without any additional explanation or commentary."
