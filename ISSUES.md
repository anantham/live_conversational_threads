# ISSUES

Last updated: 2026-01-09

## Recording & Data Retention
- Live capture does not store raw audio; cannot re-run improved ASR/diarization later.
- Browser mic session blocks parallel recorders; no way to capture a backup/high-fidelity stream alongside LCT.
- No per-speaker channel capture; group recordings are single-mix, making diarization/prayer detection harder.
- Request: speaker diarization support (e.g., HF `nvidia/diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2`).
- Request: hardware/software path to record separate channels for each participant; open question on viable multi-channel mic hardware.
- Request: prayer mic drops (Aayush, Kuil) with channel-level handling; defer to integrate with Indra's Net.

## Models & Selection
- ASR quality ceiling; no UI to choose models or switch to local models (e.g., TheWhisper).
- Need model selection UI + backend routing; desire to run locally and choose microphone device in Settings.
- No way to pick a microphone input device today.

## Live vs Import Parity
- Live view lacks edge inspection; cannot click edges to see why nodes connect.
- Live view lacks thematic generation/inspection; only available after import/persisted transcript.
- Live sessions only persist on manual save; tab loss drops data and prevents mid-session analysis.

## Graph & UI Polish
- Layout should aim to minimize edge crossings; start with the simplest viable layout option (e.g., current default before exploring layered/Sugiyama) and iterate.
- Need a user setting to hide arrows/edges entirely (Matt’s preference) and to reduce motion.
- Edge animations/colors are distracting; need toggles to reduce motion/adjust theme.
- Auto-focus/follow request: keep view aligned as the conversation progresses.
- Want a toggle so clicking a node pulls linked nodes into the current view (to avoid offscreen neighbors).
- Need a way to surface all related nodes when edges leave the viewport (e.g., related-node tray or auto-cluster).

## Timeline View Friction
- Too many degrees of freedom; frequent zoom adjustments required—needs fixed/preset zoom levels and constrained zoom.
- Edges/flow should be left-to-right for readability.
- Clicking a node in timeline should sync focus/scope in the top view.
- Horizontal scrolling should be easy/smooth.

## Priorities & Scope
- Focus first on core transcript viewing/search/retrieval and navigation; defer pipeline steps (e.g., contextual progress markers/formalism triggers) until basics are solid.

## User Stories (When/Why)
- Primary: After a live or imported meeting, I need to quickly surface decisions, action items, and supporting quotes, then export/share them for slides, docs, or follow-up messages with minimal navigation overhead.
- Creative: During a brainstorming session, I want the graph to auto-cluster related ideas and let me hide edges so I can drag a “storyline” into a deck outline without visual clutter.
- Creative: While reviewing a contentious discussion, I want to click a node and have all related nodes pulled into view, then generate a concise narrative I can fact-check before sharing with stakeholders.
- Creative: In a workshop, I want a smooth left-to-right timeline with fixed zoom presets so I can jump between moments, bookmark highlights, and later re-run higher-quality ASR/diarization on the stored audio for a polished recap.
